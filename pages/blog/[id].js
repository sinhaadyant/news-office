                          campaign we made a pledge to be 100% renewable by 2030
                          and carbon zero by 2040,” said Envato CEO Hichame

                          reached this sustainability milestone and thrilled to

                          Envato is now able to more comprehensively measure the
                          amount of carbon emissions the business generates.
                          This includes not just its physical offices in
                          Melbourne, Guadalajara and Los Angeles, but also
                          includes an estimate of the footprint of its 600 plus

                          the usage tied to its tech infrastructure including
